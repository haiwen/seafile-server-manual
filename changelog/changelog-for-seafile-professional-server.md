# Seafile Professional Server Changelog

## 6.2

From 6.2, It is recommended to use proxy mode for communication between Seahub and Nginx/Apache. Two steps are needed if you'd like to switch to WSGI mode:

1. Change the config file of Nginx/Apache.
2. Restart Seahub with `./seahub.sh start` instead of `./seahub.sh start-fastcgi`

The configuration of Nginx is as following:

```
location / {
         proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:8000;
         proxy_set_header   Host $host;
         proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
         proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
         proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Host $server_name;
         proxy_read_timeout  1200s;

         # used for view/edit office file via Office Online Server
         client_max_body_size 0;

         access_log      /var/log/nginx/seahub.access.log;
         error_log       /var/log/nginx/seahub.error.log;
    }
```

The configuration of Apache is as following:

```
    # seahub
    SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

You can follow the document on minor upgrade (http://manual.seafile.com/deploy/upgrade.html).

Special note for upgrading a cluster:

In version 6.0, the folder download mechanism has been updated. This requires that, in a cluster deployment, seafile-data/httptemp folder must be in an NFS share. You can make this folder a symlink to the NFS share.

```
cd /data/haiwen/
ln -s /nfs-share/seafile-httptemp seafile-data/httptemp
```

The httptemp folder only contains temp files for downloading/uploading file on web UI. So there is no reliability requirement for the NFS share. You can export it from any node in the cluster.
