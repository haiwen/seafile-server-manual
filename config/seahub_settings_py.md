# Seahub Settings

Note: You can also modify most of the config items via web interface. The config items are saved in database table (seahub-db/constance_config). They have a higher priority over the items in config files. If you want to disable settings via web interface, you can add `ENABLE_SETTINGS_VIA_WEB = False` to `seahub_settings.py`.

##  Sending Email Notifications on Seahub

Refer to [email sending documentation](sending_email.md).

## Memcached

Seahub caches items(avatars, profiles, etc) on file system by default(/tmp/seahub_cache/). You can replace with Memcached.

Refer to ["add memcached"](../deploy/add_memcached.md).

Options for libraries:

```python
# mininum length for password of encrypted library
REPO_PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH = 8

# mininum length for password for share link (since version 4.4)
SHARE_LINK_PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH = 8

# NOTE: since version 1.4.
USE_PDFJS = True

# Online preview maximum file size, defaults to 30M.

# In pro edition, for preview doc/ppt/excel/pdf, there is another option `max-size`
# in seafevents.conf that controls the limit of files that can be previewed.
FILE_PREVIEW_MAX_SIZE = 30 * 1024 * 1024

# Extensions of previewed text files.

# Default size for picture preview. Enlarge this size can improve the preview quality.
# NOTE: since version 6.1.1
THUMBNAIL_SIZE_FOR_ORIGINAL = 1024
```

## Cloud Mode

You should enable cloud mode if you use Seafile with an unknown user base. It disables the organization tab in Seahub's website to ensure that users can't access the user list. Cloud mode provides some nice features like sharing content with unregistered users and sending invitations to them. Therefore you also want to enable user registration. Through the global address book (since version 4.2.3) you can do a search for every user account. So you probably want to disable it.

```python
# Enable cloude mode and hide `Organization` tab.
CLOUD_MODE = True

# Disable global address book
ENABLE_GLOBAL_ADDRESSBOOK = False
```


## External authentication

```python
# Enable authentication with ADFS
# Default is False
# Since 6.0.9
ENABLE_ADFS_LOGIN = True

# Enable authentication wit Kerberos
# Default is False
ENABLE_KRB5_LOGIN = True

# Enable authentication with Shibboleth
# Default is False
ENABLE_SHIBBOLETH_LOGIN = True
```

## Other options


```python
# Disable settings via Web interface in system admin->settings
# Default is True
# Since 5.1.3
ENABLE_SETTINGS_VIA_WEB = False

TIME_ZONE = 'UTC'

# Language code for this installation. All choices can be found here:
# http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/language-identifiers.html
# Default language for sending emails.
LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'

# Set this to your website/company's name. This is contained in email notifications and welcome message when user login for the first time.
SITE_NAME = 'Seafile'

# Browser tab's title
SITE_TITLE = 'Private Seafile'

# If you don't want to run seahub website on your site's root path, set this option to your preferred path.
# e.g. setting it to '/seahub/' would run seahub on http://example.com/seahub/.
SITE_ROOT = '/'

# Max number of files when user upload file/folder.
# Since version 6.0.4
MAX_NUMBER_OF_FILES_FOR_FILEUPLOAD = 500

# Since version 6.1.1
SHARE_LINK_EMAIL_LANGUAGE = ''

# Since version 6.0
ENABLE_TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS = True

# Enable two factor authentication for accounts. Defaults to `False`.
# Since version 6.0
ENABLE_TWO_FACTOR_AUTH = True

# Enable user select a template when he/she creates library.
# When user select a template, Seafile will create folders releated to the pattern automaticly.
# Since version 6.0
LIBRARY_TEMPLATES = {
    'Technology': ['/Develop/Python', '/Test'],
    'Finance': ['/Current assets', '/Fixed assets/Computer']
}

# Send email to these email addresses when a virus is detected.
# This list can be any valid email address, not necessarily the emails of Seafile user.
# Since version 6.0.8
VIRUS_SCAN_NOTIFY_LIST = ['user_a@seafile.com', 'user_b@seafile.com']
```

## RESTful API

```
# API throttling related settings. Enlarger the rates if you got 429 response code during API calls.
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'ping': '600/minute',
        'anon': '5/minute',
        'user': '300/minute',
    },
    'UNICODE_JSON': False,
}

# Throtting whitelist used to disable throttle for certain IPs.
# e.g. REST_FRAMEWORK_THROTTING_WHITELIST = ['127.0.0.1', '192.168.1.1']
# Please make sure `REMOTE_ADDR` header is configured in Nginx conf according to https://manual.seafile.com/deploy/deploy_with_nginx.html.
REST_FRAMEWORK_THROTTING_WHITELIST = []
```

## Seahub Custom Functions

Since version 6.2, you can define a custome function to modify the result of user search function.

For example, if you want to limit user only search users in the same institution, you can define `custom_search_user` function in `{seafile install path}/conf/seahub_custom_functions/__init__.py`

Code example:

```
import os
import sys

current_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
seahub_dir = os.path.join(current_path, \
        '../../seafile-server-latest/seahub/seahub')
sys.path.append(seahub_dir)

from seahub.profile.models import Profile
def custom_search_user(request, emails):

    institution_name = ''

    username = request.user.username
    profile = Profile.objects.get_profile_by_user(username)
    if profile:
        institution_name = profile.institution

    inst_users = [p.user for p in
            Profile.objects.filter(institution=institution_name)]

    filtered_emails = []
    for email in emails:
        if email in inst_users:
            filtered_emails.append(email)

    return filtered_emails
```

> **NOTE**, you should NOT change the name of `custom_search_user` and `seahub_custom_functions/__init__.py`

Since version 6.2.5 pro, if you enable the **ENABLE_SHARE_TO_ALL_GROUPS** feather on sysadmin settings page, you can also define a custom function to return the groups a user can share library to.

For example, if you want to let a user to share library to both its groups and the groups of user `test@test.com`, you can define a `custom_get_groups` function in `{seafile install path}/conf/seahub_custom_functions/__init__.py`

Code example:

```
import os
import sys

current_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
seaserv_dir = os.path.join(current_path, \
        '../../seafile-server-latest/seafile/lib64/python2.7/site-packages')
sys.path.append(seaserv_dir)

def custom_get_groups(request):

    from seaserv import ccnet_api

    groups = []
    username = request.user.username

    # for current user
    groups += ccnet_api.get_groups(username)

    # for 'test@test.com' user
    groups += ccnet_api.get_groups('test@test.com')

    return groups
```

> **NOTE**, you should NOT change the name of `custom_get_groups` and `seahub_custom_functions/__init__.py`

## Note

* You need to restart seahub so that your changes take effect.
* If your changes don't take effect, You may need to delete 'seahub_setting.pyc'. (A cache file)

```bash
./seahub.sh restart
```
