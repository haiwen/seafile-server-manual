# Upgrade manual

This page is for users who use the pre-compiled seafile server package.
- If you [build seafile server from source](../build_seafile/server.md), please read the **Upgrading Seafile Server** section on that page, instead of this one.
- After upgrading, you may need to clean [seahub cache](add_memcached.md) if it doesn't behave as expect.
- If you are running a **cluster**, please read [upgrade a Seafile cluster](../deploy_pro/upgrade_a_cluster.md).

## Upgrade notes
Please check the [upgrade notes](upgrade_notes.md) for any special configuration or changes before/while upgrading.

## Major version upgrade (like from 4.x.x to 5.y.y)


Suppose you are using version 4.3.0 and like to upgrade to version 5.0.0. First download and extract the new version. You should have a directory layout similar to this:


```
haiwen
   -- seafile-server-4.3.0
   -- seafile-server-5.0.0
   -- ccnet
   -- seafile-data
```


Now upgrade to version 5.0.0.

1. Shutdown Seafile server if it's running

   ```sh
   cd haiwen/seafile-server-4.3.0
   ./seahub.sh stop
   ./seafile.sh stop
   # or via service
   /etc/init.d/seafile-server stop
   ```
2. Check the upgrade scripts in seafile-server-5.0.0 directory.

   ```sh
   cd haiwen/seafile-server-5.0.0
   ls upgrade/upgrade_*
   ```

   You will get a list of upgrade files:

   ```
   ...
   upgrade/upgrade_4.0_4.1.sh
   upgrade/upgrade_4.1_4.2.sh
   upgrade/upgrade_4.2_4.3.sh
   upgrade/upgrade_4.3_4.4.sh
   upgrade/upgrade_4.4_5.0.sh
   ```

3. Start from your current version, run the script(s one by one)

   ```
   upgrade/upgrade_4.3_4.4.sh
   upgrade/upgrade_4.4_5.0.sh
   ```

4. Start the new server version as for any upgrade

   ```sh
   cd haiwen/seafile-server-5.0.0/
   ./seafile.sh start
   ./seahub.sh start # or "./seahub.sh start-fastcgi" if you're using fastcgi
   # or via service
   /etc/init.d/seafile-server start
   ```
5. If the new version works fine, the old version can be removed

   ```sh
   rm -rf seafile-server-4.3.0/
   ```
   or alternatively be moved to the directory installed (in case you set it up)
   
    ```sh
   mv seafile-server-4.3.0/ installed/
   ```

## Minor version upgrade (like from 5.0.x to 5.1.y)

Suppose you are using version 5.0.0 and like to upgrade to version 5.1.0. First download and extract the new version. You should have a directory layout similar to this:


```
haiwen
   -- seafile-server-5.0.0
   -- seafile-server-5.1.0
   -- ccnet
   -- seafile-data
```


Now upgrade to version 5.1.0.

1. Shutdown Seafile server if it's running

   ```sh
   cd haiwen/seafile-server-5.0.0
   ./seahub.sh stop
   ./seafile.sh stop
   # or via service
   /etc/init.d/seafile-server stop
   ```
2. Check the upgrade scripts in seafile-server-5.1.0 directory.

   ```sh
   cd haiwen/seafile-server-5.1.0
   ls upgrade/upgrade_*
   ```

   You will get a list of upgrade files:

   ```
   ...
   upgrade/upgrade_4.0_4.1.sh
   upgrade/upgrade_4.1_4.2.sh
   upgrade/upgrade_4.2_4.3.sh
   upgrade/upgrade_4.3_4.4.sh
   upgrade/upgrade_4.4_5.0.sh
   upgrade/upgrade_5.0_5.1.sh
   ```

3. Start from your current version, run the script(s one by one)

   ```
   upgrade/upgrade_5.0_5.1.sh
   ```

4. Start the new server version as for any upgrade

   ```sh
   cd haiwen/seafile-server-5.1.0/
   ./seafile.sh start
   ./seahub.sh start # or "./seahub.sh start-fastcgi" if you're using fastcgi
   # or via service
   /etc/init.d/seafile-server start
   ```
5. If the new version works file, the old version can be removed

   ```sh
   rm -rf seafile-server-5.0.0/
   ```
   or alternatively be moved to the directory installed (in case you set it up)
   
    ```sh
   mv seafile-server-5.0.0/ installed/
   ```

## Maintenance version upgrade (like from 5.1.2 to 5.1.3)

Maintenance upgrade is like an upgrade from 5.1.2 to 5.1.3.


1. Stop the current server first as for any other upgrade
2. For this type of upgrade, you only need to update the symbolic links (for avatar and a few other folders). 
We provide a script for you, just run it (For history reason, the script called `minor-upgrade.sh`):

   ```sh
   cd seafile-server-5.1.2
   upgrade/minor-upgrade.sh
   ```

3. Start the new server version as for any other upgrade

4. If the new version works file, the old version can be removed

   ```sh
   rm -rf seafile-server-5.1.2/
   ```
   or alternatively be moved to the directory installed (in case you set it up)
   
    ```sh
   mv seafile-server-5.1.2/ installed/
   ```
